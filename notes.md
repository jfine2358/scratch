Have three boxes, stacked on top of each other.

Guess a good value for min-height.

Synchronize height of display boxes.

Improve location of solution box.

Problem: inline-block display of render box.

Use (solution, answer) and (show, input, render) as identifiers.

Make it look pretty - BlanchedAlmond background colour.

Improve instructions on index.html.

Focus on the 'answer_input' box.
